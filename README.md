# Alien Invasion Experience
This is just me having fun making an engine for threejs. It can be used for best practices when it comes to large threejs projects. Moreover its fun to watch!

# scripts
### npm install
    used to install all needed dependencies

### npm run build
    used to build the program into a static build folder

### npm start
    used to start the program and run it on localhost:3000

# TODO
* Update resume to be the one on cpanel
* manifest.json  
* make the sun glow... although no one sees it :/
* make earth clouds not twitchy  
* make stars bigger  
* the loader should be passed around rather then a singleton so that its not used like a global variable with unknown state. This also allows for more scene states for loading chunks at a time 
* add raycaster stoping for lazers and missles
* ui with start  
* make a chat with my face in it saying whats occuring
* dispatch event on events like explosion so that we can make listeners for shaking camera.
* add in accuracy to weapons
* add burst to weapons
