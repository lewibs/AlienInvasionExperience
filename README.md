# TODO
* Update resume to be the one on cpanel
* manifest.json  
* make the sun glow... although no one sees it :/
* make earth clouds not twitchy  
* make stars bigger  
* the loader should be passed around rather then a singleton so that its not used like a global variable with unknown state. This also allows for more scene states for loading chunks at a time 
* add raycaster stoping for lazers and missles
* ui with start  
* make a chat with my face in it saying whats occuring
* dispatch event on events like explosion so that we can make listeners for shaking camera.
* add in accuracy to weapons
* add burst to weapons
